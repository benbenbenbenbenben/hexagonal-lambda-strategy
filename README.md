# hexagonal-lambda-strategy

This is an exploratory example of a hexagonal FaaS pattern.

It is written with the limitations of AWS Lambda in mind and I think as patterns go it does a decent job of establishing one (read: reducing developer cognitive load).

It helps the clients I coach to prioritise reasoning about application domains over dreading how otherwise sensible functions integrate with AWS Lambda's wildly inconsistent entry mechanisms and whilst still being testable.
